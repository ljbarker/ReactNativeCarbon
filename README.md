# CalHacks 10.0 Building Apps Workshop Demo

To get started:

```bash
cd [REPO_NAME]
yarn install
expo install
expo start
```

Sections that need to be updated have been marked with `TODO` comments; you should search for these and update them. There is no precise order that these must be filled out in, but it is recommended to go roughly in the following order:

1. `CarbonDataType.tsx` - sets up the typing for data items
2. `App.tsx` - sets up navigation

The following three files can be filled out in any order; they are all related to getting and displaying search results. 3. `SearchScreen.tsx` 4. `HistoryScreen.tsx` 5. `Item.tsx`

For hints:

-   Look at other files!
-   `SearchScreen.tsx` and `HistoryScreen.tsx` are very similar in many ways
-   Read the comments which indicate what you should be doing
-   Leverage the type annotatiosn when you can and take advantage of the TypeScript setup within the project
